# Bookstore_Management_system
## The aim of the project is to use Java to write a software for a bookstore. This system could display the book list, the customer list and the rent book list of a customer by java GUI. Users could search a book by a book name or author name, or search a book by a customer name, email address or phone number.  The owner of the software can add new books or new customer to his/her database through the GUI. When renting a book or returning a book, the copies numbers and his rent record will be updated. User could also search what books he/she has rent by input his last name. Three txt files Booklist.txt, Customerlist.txt and BookCustomerlist.txt were used to store the information of books, customers and customerâ€™s renting record. These information was read into ArrayList objects, and visualized by Java swing JTable and JList. Users could click different tab to display 3 types of information (Figure 1a-c). All renting or returning actions will be write into three txt files dynamically. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70253071/147511595-39ddc3c6-a2fd-4d1f-b270-85c5e128489f.png)
